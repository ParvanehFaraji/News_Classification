# News_Classification
In this project, I classify news data as either fake or real. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The text data (news descriptions) is preprocessed, and several binary classification methods are used for this task:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
I also visualized the performance of each model by plotting confusion matrices. The results show that the Random Forest model performs significantly better compared to the other models.
